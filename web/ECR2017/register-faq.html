        <h1>Registration FAQs</h1>
        
        <h3>What is the format of the contest?</h3>
        <p>Each competitor will perform a freestyle trick routine on stage with music of choice. A panel of judges will give scores to each routine in accordance to the International Yo-Yo Federation's <a target="_blank" href="http://iyyf.org/rules/freestyle-rule/">guidelines</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What are 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A?</h3>
        <p>These are the five major styles of competitive play. See <a href="http://yoyoexpert.com/learn/002-basic-five-styles.php" target="_blank">this video</a> for a quick overview.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What is Open division? Why do I need choose a style for it?</h3>
        <p>Open division is where competitors can perform any style that is not 1A. In other words, any one of 2A, 3A, 4A, or 5A is allowed. In bigger contests like Nationals or Worlds, competitors of different styles compete in separate divisions. However in Regionals, each non-1A style typically does not have enough competitors to hold separate divisions. Instead, all non-1A competitors will compete against each other in one division called "Open".
        </p>
        <p>You are allowed and encouraged to enter both 1A and Open divisions. In Open division, though, you are only allowed to perform one style, and you need to choose which one when you register. See <a href="rules.html">rules</a> for further information.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I am competing in 1A. When I upload music, what are "Preliminary" and "Final"? Do I need to upload to both?</h3>
        <p>The 1A division is typically so popular (and competitive!) that a preliminary round is needed to select only the top competitors to advance to the final round. This is why all 1A competitors should prepare to perform freestyles and upload music for both preliminary and final rounds.
        </p>
        <p>However, if there are too few competitors in the division, then everyone will automatically enter the final round. If this happens, it  will be announced shortly after the registration deadline.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I don't live in Ontario or Quebec. Can I still compete?</h3>
        <p>Everyone regardless of country or province of origin can compete for titles and prizes, but only the residents of Ontario and Quebec are eligible for the seed to Canadian Nationals 2018.
