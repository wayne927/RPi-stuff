Lift your Freehand upwards keeping the yo-yo in front of the string and place the yo-yo on the string just above your Throwhand. Cause the yo-yo to climb up the string, keeping it in contact with the string all the way up to just below your Freehand. Now reverse the direction and let the yo-yo come down keeping it in contact with the string all the way down to just above your Throwhand. Lower yo-yo back to a Sleeper and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Braintwister (1 Somersault):<br />
			Throw a Sleeper and then perform a front mount. Now let your Throwhand index finger come up around the yo-yo and push the string segments half way between the yo-yo and the Freehand index finger causing the yo-yo to rotate around your Freehand completing one or more somersaults. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Trapeze:<br />
			Throw a Breakaway and catch the yo-yo on the string over your index finger of your Freehand and let the yo-yo spin on the string. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Split the Atom (3 somersaults):<br />
			Throw a split-bottom mount and perform a pass under the yo-yo with your Freehand index finger, then push forward into the double string segments with your Freehand index finger followed by a pass under the yo-yo with your Throwhand index finger.

Bring your Freehand under the yo-yo, landing it on the outermost upper string, and pull your Freehand index finger out leaving you in a 1.5-mount. Sling the yo-yo over towards your Freehand, and then back over your Throwhand, letting the yo-yo wrap around your index finger one more time. Unravel the wraps and land the yoyo back into a trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Pop'n'Fresh (2 reps):<br />
			Perform a split-bottom mount directly into a Mach 5 hold (no string shortening somersaults allowed). The yo-yo will be on top of the strings between the Throwhand (front) and Freehand (back). Perform a pop and quickly switch the position of the Throwhand and Freehand. The yo-yo will now be on the bottom string in a split-bottom mount. Perform a second upward pop, and again quickly switch the position of the Throwhand and Freehand. The yo-yo should be back on top of the strings completing one rep.

			<li>Boingy Boingy (5 Reps):<br />
			Start with a split-bottom mount and while holding your Freehand still, cause the yo-yo to bounce out and back between string segments by performing short and quick up and down movements of your Throwhand. Each rep consists of a full bounce contacting the front and back segments. Complete five or more reps. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Gyroscopic Flop:<br />
			Throw a trapeze mount and with your Freehand wrap string around yo-yo into an Oliver Twist hold. Pull on strings causing the yo-yo to rotate (flop) 180 degrees around the string. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Kwijibo:<br />
			Throw a trapeze mount, then perform an upward pop into a wrist-crossed one-and-a-half mount hold (with Throwhand over Freehand), then roll Throwhand over and under Freehand into a wrist-crossed one-and-a-half mount hold (with Freehand over Throwhand), then pop to a double or nothing hold, then pop to a trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			Note that yo-yo must be popped upward on all three hops, and on the first pop the Throwhand must be clearly crossed over the Freehand so that the yo-yo is caught in the middle of a ‘close to’ horizontal wrist-crossed one-and-a-half mount hold.</li>

			<li>Hook:<br />
			Also known as Hidemasa Hook. Throw a breakaway to a sleeper in front you. Extend the index finger from the free hand as you would for a Trapeze. With the yo-yo sleeping in front of you, pop the yo-yo up just below the free hand index finger. While the yo-yo is ‘floating’, swing the slack string under the yo-yo and the free hand index finger so that a U-shaped loop forms from under the free hand index finger. Allow the U-shaped loop to hit the underside of the free hand index finger and swing over the top of the finger. The U-shaped loop should the swing the outer string of the loop into the string gap. Roll the yo-yo over the free hand back to a bind in a modified trapeze hold. Unbind the trapeze hold and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Suicide Catch (2 Reps):<br />
			Throw a trapeze mount, let the yo-yo swing under the Throwhand and pull your Freehand index finger out of the wrap and let the string segments loop over your Throwhand. As the loop comes over the Throwhand poke your Freehand index finger back into the loop. At this point you should be back in a trapeze hold completing one rep. Perform a second rep back to a trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Iron Whip (2 Reps):<br />
			Throw a trapeze mount, grab an open loop with Throwhand, pop yo-yo out of trapeze, lasso yo-yo with a whip catch with the open loop, and roll back to a trapeze hold. Perform two or more reps. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Kamikaze:<br />
			Throw a 'Houdini Drop' double or nothing hold using the thumb and index finger of your Freehand. Pop yo-yo upwards towards the top string segment and let the string segment drop off of your thumb simultaneously. The string should hit the underside of the top string and drop into a Side-style Mach 5 hold. Roll the yo-yo over your Throwhand index finger. Now with your Freehand index finger hook and pull the front string segment towards your body while letting the inside segment fall of your Freehand index finger. Now pop the yo-yo in front of the strings and land it on top of all the strings. At this point, or during the previous hop, you can untwist the string segment held on your Freehand index finger. Roll the yo-yo over your freehand index finger and you will be in a Trapeze hold. Next perform a Magic Drop as in Shock Wave. Now pop the yo-yo upward and hit the bottom of top string and let the yo-yo roll over your Throwhand index finger. Next reverse the direction of the roll and miss all strings. Let the yo-yo continue a second roll and land of the top string (furthest from your body). Reverse the direction of the roll again missing all strings. Let the yo-yo continue to roll and hit the bottom of the top string as it goes over your Throwhand index finger. Reverse the direction of the roll one last time landing the yo-yo on the bottom string. Let the outermost segment fall off your Freehand so you are back in a Trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Sprit Bomb:<br />
			Throw a Breakaway over Freehand index finger (not over thumb) into a wrist-bucket mount; perform a double pass under with Freehand index finger. Pop yo-yo up, bring Throwhand under and catch yo-yo on outermost string segment. Pop yoyo up, uncross arms, and catch yo-yo over Freehand index finger back into wrist-bucket mount (Note that the yo-yo has to pass through the triangle formed over your Throwhand and land on bottom string segment). Perform a double pass under with Freehand index finger onto back string segment and pull into trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Throwhand Grind (2-Grinds):<br />
			Trapeze mount, reverse pinwheel off trapeze into a grind on top (or side) of the Throwhand, slide the yo-yo back onto the string into a Trapeze hold. Perform 1 somersault, in the same direction as the pinwheel, letting the momentum of the somersault toss the yo-yo onto the top (or side) of the Throwhand into a second grind. Slide yo-yo off the top of the Throwhand onto the string back into a Trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>

			<li>Black Hop:<br />
			Start with Triple or Nothing mount over both index fingers (note that you can not throw the Triple or Nothing over your thumbs or other fingers to spread the strings apart), hop down to Trapeze in 4 hops then back to a hold similar (but not quite) to a Triple or Nothing in 4 hops (more like undercuts). After all 8 hops pull your Throwhand index finger out of the hold and rotate the Yo-Yo 2 revolutions into a Trapeze hold. Perform any dismount and return the yo-yo to your hand by the method of your choice.</li>
