# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#item1 = Message.create(content: "Item 1 seeded for Message")
#item1 = Message.create(content: "Item 2 another thing seeded for Message")

note1 = Note.create(title: 'First note!', content: 'This is the first note seeded into the database', color: 'yellow')
